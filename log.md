### Day 3: January 02, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Setting up an express.js project and link my database with it.

**Thoughts**: Still not working, I manage to make the "MongoDB compass" work and edit manually the base, get the right adress to connect to my database but I still doesnt success in reading or editing anything...
The guides was using older versions of Mongodb, now working using the official doc.
