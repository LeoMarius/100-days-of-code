### Day 15: January 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continue on FreeCodecamp and start playing with ThreeJs

**Thoughts**: I only made one Intermediate Algorithm to keep the strike, I will now find the equivalents on codewars to do them, better UI and feedback when finished.
I made the basics setup with ThreeJs and then watched the all "Dive in Threejs" youtube playlist (lot of interesting stuff that I'm never use...)
