# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned and pushed on github the videoVerrePlayer.

**Thoughts:** Was a code I left on side more than 6 month ago, still complicated to find back your marks and understand eveithing on it, still a lot of work to do on it.

**Today's Progress**: Setting up a Mongodb Atlas data base.

**Thoughts**: I watched mongobd atlas video tutorials up to the video 11, the cluster is online and ip whitelist done, still trying to connect my app to the db.
